<p>
My name is Gurkmal Deol and I'm a Machine Learning Engineer and Biologist. My interests include AI driven drug discovery, computer vision, & federated learning.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently working on two projects when I have free time and I often switch between them. My goal this year is to complete the 100 days of coding challenge beggining on March 23rd.
</p>

**1. Federated learning:**
— Writing jupyter notebooks about federated learning to learn more about privacy perserving AI using OpenMined and PySyft.
— Building a remote data science marketplace POC using Duet and the Ethereum blockchain

**2. Deep learning: **
— Implementing a range of deep learning algorithms for computer vision on agriculture image data. Specifically weed detection.
— Building a hexapod robot to use with a trained weed detection model to kill weeds and improve crop yield and health.

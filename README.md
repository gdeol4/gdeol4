<p>
My name is Gurkmal Deol and I'm a machine learning engineer and biologist. My interests include AI driven drug discovery, computer vision, & federated learning.
</p>

<p>
I'm also an avid woodworker, I enjoy gardening (especialy fruits), and when I can I like to read scifi-fantasy.

## Currently working on

<p>
I'm currently working on three projects in my free time and I often switch between them:
</p>

**1. Federated learning:**
* Writing jupyter notebooks about federated learning to learn more about privacy preserving AI using OpenMined and PySyft.
  * build a simple web app to connect and recieve fitbit data
  * configure and run raspbarry pi 4 as data server (data owner)
* Building a remote data science marketplace POC using PySyft and the Ethereum blockchain
  * Build a decentralized app based on Ethereum
  * Learn Solidity for smart contracts
  * Learn enough react.js to build a front end for the POC

**2. Deep learning:**
* Implementing a range of deep learning algorithms for computer vision on agriculture image data. Specifically weed detection.
  * Procure more data
  * Train OpenCV3 model on weed identification dataset
* Building a hexapod robot to use with a trained weed detection model to identify and harm weeds to improve crop yield and health.
  * Assemble raspberry pi 4 based hexapod

**3. UofT ML term project:**
* Using industrial data from a Canadian broadcast and advertising company to predicting live TV audience size.
  * feature engineering, using regressors for model explainability, seaborn visualizations.
## Projects:

#### Web apps
* [Frodotype Text Generator](https://frodotype.me) ‚Äî I built a serverless and asynchronous web app with an end to end NLP model trained on 100 fantasy novels using GPT2. Deep learning performed using Google deep learning VM and tensorflow, built using python and javascript, deployed using Google cloud run and Starlette.

* [Mutating Selfies - Generating novel drugs](https://share.streamlit.io/gdeol4/mutating-selfies/app.py) ‚Äî A quick streamlit web app I built using RDKit which showcases the ability of the STONED SELFIES algorithm to generate novel drug molecules using genetic algorithms instead of a GPU.

* [Toxic SMILES](https://toxic-smiles.onrender.com) ‚Äî I deployed a dockerized machine learning web app on Microsoft Azure. The app is built using RDKit, Flask, Scikit-learn, and a logiostic regression model which I trained on the Tox21 dataset. My model achieves an accuracy of 96.4%. 

* [AutoML for drug discovery](https://share.streamlit.io/gdeol4/pycaret_solubility/mol_sol.py) ‚Äî I built this streamlit web app to showcase the use of AutoML for drug discovery. The app uses PyCaret for quick machine learning model prototyping and RDKit to handle and process molecular data. However, due to memory leaking and streamlit's minimal memory allocation, the web app will crash after a certain number of uses. The cost of hosting this app elsewhere would simply be too much at the moment.

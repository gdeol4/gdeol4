<p>
My name is Gurkmal Deol and I'm a developer building cheminformatics and bioinformatics software. I primarily use Python for backend engineering, machine learning, and data analytics. Areas of interest include QSAR, molecular docking, drug design, and development.

I also like to woodwork, garden, and read scifi.

## Currently working on


## Projects:

#### Web apps
* [Frodotype Text Generator](https://frodotype.me) ‚Äî I built a serverless and asynchronous web app with an end to end NLP model trained on 100 fantasy novels using GPT2. Deep learning performed using Google deep learning VM and tensorflow, built using python and javascript, deployed using Google cloud run and Starlette.

* [Mutating Selfies - Generating novel drugs](https://share.streamlit.io/gdeol4/mutating-selfies/app.py) ‚Äî A quick streamlit web app I built using RDKit which showcases the ability of the STONED SELFIES algorithm to generate novel drug molecules using genetic algorithms instead of a GPU.

* [Toxic SMILES](https://toxic-smiles.onrender.com) ‚Äî I deployed a dockerized machine learning web app on Microsoft Azure. The app is built using RDKit, Flask, Scikit-learn, and a logiostic regression model which I trained on the Tox21 dataset. My model achieves an accuracy of 96.4%.
